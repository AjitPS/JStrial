@descripion A simple network view example implemented using CytoscapeJS along with its cxtmenu plugin, JQuery UI, Qtip, event handlers and layout libraries such as CoLa, Arbor, dagre, springy and CoSE. The example illustrates key features of cytoscapeJS for network view such as:

1) Nodes (concepts) and Edges (relations) using custom data, shape, size and colour
2) CoLa layout (a force-directed layout using the CoLa algorithm, similar to the Gem layout in Ondex Web).
3) a circular context menu using the cytoscape cxtmenu plugin.
4) event handling on node and edge elemnts.
5) show all/ hide elements (nodes or edges).
6) Selecting multiple elements using Shift + click. The selections made can be displayed via the context menu --> "Show selections" which shows a list of all the selected elements in a JQuery UI dialog.
7) Panning (dragging) the entire network via a mouse drag event.
8) Item Info. dialog pop up upon clicking a node or edge and selecting "Item Info." from the circular context menu.
& more.
