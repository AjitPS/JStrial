@descripion A simple network view example implemented using CytoscapeJS along with its cxtmenu plugin, JQuery UI, Qtip, event handlers and layout libraries such as CoLa, Arbor, dagre, springy and CoSE. The example illustrates key features of cytoscapeJS for network view such as:

1) Nodes (concepts) and Edges (relations) using custom data, shape, size and colour
2) CoLa layout (a force-directed layout using the CoLa algorithm, similar to the Gem layout in Ondex Web).
3) a circular context menu.
4) event handling on node and edge elemnts.
5) show/ hide elements.
6) Selecting multiple elements using Shift + click
& more.
